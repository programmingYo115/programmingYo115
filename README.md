Hello everyone! It's me, @programmingYo115. My actual name is Yosef.
I'm an intermediate JavaScript programmer and looking to collab with guys on this Internet. If you feel like I'm eligible for getting partnered by you, please contact me!!!
I also know some Java.
To contact me, I will mostly be active in my chess.com account @BeCoolAndNeverAFoolYo.
